<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Every JPA application that requires some kind of dynamic queries for e.g. filtering has to decide between duplicating parts of queries or building queries conditionally.
JPA offers the Criteria API for constructing such dynamic queries, but using this API often results in unreadable and hard to maintain code.
Concatenating query string parts is often an alternative that might even work for simple cases, but quickly falls apart in many real world scenarios.
Implementing pagination with JPA and especially when fetching collections is hard to do efficiently and often sub-optimal ways are chosen for keeping maintainability.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>{projectname} is a library that lives on top of a JPA provider and tries to solve these and many more problems a developer faces when having complex requirements.
It is composed of multiple modules that all depend on the core module which this documentation deals with.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The core module tries to ease the pain of writing dynamic queries by offering a fluent builder API that puts readability first.
In addition to that, it also integrates deeply with the JPA provider to provide advanced SQL features that not even the JPA providers offer.
The deep integration makes it possible to even workaround some known JPA provider bugs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <a href="{entity_view_doc}">entity view module</a> builds on top of the core module and provides a way to define DTOs with mappings to the entity model.
The mapping information is used in the query builder to generate projections that perfectly fit the DTO structure along with possible required joins.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The jpa-criteria module is an implementation of the JPA Criteria API based on the query builder of the core module.
It offers extensions to the JPA Criteria API that enable the use of some of the concepts and advanced features that are also offered by the core module.
The main intent of this module is to ease the migration of existing queries or to allow the use of advanced features in existing queries on a case by case basis.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can view the {projectname} core module as being a builder for query objects similar to the JPA Criteria API. The builder generally tries to check correctness as early as possible,
but defers some checks to query generation time which allows to write query building code that looks almost like JPQL.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Behind the scenes {projectname} core generates a JPQL query or a provider native query string. When advanced features like e.g. CTEs are used, the query string represents the <em>logical query structure</em>
and looks very much like a possible future revision of JPQL.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The developers of {projectname} see entity views as a better alternative to JPA 2.1 entity graphs which is why there is no special support for entity graphs.
Nevertheless, using entity graph with queries produced by {projectname} shouldn&#8217;t be a problem as long as no advanced features are used and can be applied as usual via query hints.
Also note that entity graphs require a JPA 2.1 implementation whereas entity views also work with a provider that only implements JPA 2.0.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>{projectname} core requires at least Java 1.7 and at least a JPA 2.0 implementation.</p>
